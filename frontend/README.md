This project is a skeleton for a social media application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Getting Started

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Main source code (React components in TypeScript)
- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `public/` - Static assets

## Components

- **Button** - Customizable button with variants and sizes
- **Avatar** - User avatar with fallback text and online status
- **Card** - Container component with different styles
